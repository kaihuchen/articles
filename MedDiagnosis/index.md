# Medical Diagnosis with a Panel of Chatbots

<!-- *Last updated: March 15, 2024* -->

*DRAFT*


The three-round debate log between two chatbots concerning the diagnosis based on an X-ray image of a young boy who has swallowed a toy piece reveals an iterative refinement process in the diagnosis. Here’s how the debate appears to improve the overall diagnosis:
Round 1: Initial Diagnoses

    Both chatbots provide a list of possible objects the child might have swallowed, based on the X-ray image. Their analyses cover common scenarios in pediatric ingestion cases, like toy parts and batteries.
    Participant #1 (Anthropic Claude-3) gives a structured list of possible ingested objects, prioritized by likelihood, and suggests medical interventions.
    Participant #2 (OpenAI GPT-4) offers a more general analysis, emphasizing the need for medical attention without committing to a specific likelihood ranking.

Round 2: Critique and Reassessment

    Both participants critique the initial assessments, refining the list of possibilities and adjusting the probability estimates for each potential object.
    This round helps in refining the thought process, leading to more precise probability assessments and a focused list of the most likely ingested objects.

Round 3: Resolution and Synthesis

    The chatbots reconcile their diagnoses, converging on a common list of probable objects, with a toy piece being the most likely object ingested.
    They eliminate less likely possibilities, providing a more streamlined and agreed-upon diagnosis.

Evidence of Improvement

    Refinement of Probabilities: The iterative process allows each chatbot to refine its probability assessments, leading to a more nuanced understanding of the most likely scenario.
    Consensus on Diagnosis: By the third round, both chatbots reach a consensus on the likelihood of different objects, indicating a refined and collective confidence in the diagnosis.
    Focused Analysis: The process helps in narrowing down the list of potential objects, focusing the diagnosis on the most likely and medically relevant possibilities.

The debate process facilitates a dynamic refinement of the initial assessments, leading to a more accurate and consensus-based diagnosis. It mimics a collaborative medical team’s approach, where different opinions are considered, critiqued, and synthesized to arrive at a more accurate diagnosis. This iterative process appears to enhance the overall diagnostic accuracy and provides a more detailed and critically evaluated medical assessment.

ChatGPT

Using a three-round debate process with AI chatbots, like the one demonstrated in the analysis of an X-ray image, could serve as a valuable tool for physicians in several ways:
Enhanced Diagnostic Accuracy

    Multiple Perspectives: Physicians can benefit from the diverse perspectives offered by different AI models, which mimic a multidisciplinary team approach. Each AI chatbot, based on its unique training and algorithms, can provide different insights or highlight aspects that others might overlook.
    Iterative Refinement: The structured debate format allows for an iterative refinement of diagnoses, where initial assessments are critically evaluated and improved upon, leading to a more accurate final diagnosis.

Decision Support

    Probability Assessment: AI chatbots can offer probability assessments for different diagnoses, helping physicians weigh the likelihood of various conditions. This can be particularly useful in complex cases where the symptoms and signs might point to multiple possible diagnoses.
    Critique and Validation: The critique phase in the debate process allows for the validation of initial diagnostic thoughts, helping to identify any potential biases or oversights and reinforcing the reasoning behind certain diagnostic choices.

Continuous Learning and Improvement

    Dynamic Learning Process: Engaging with AI in such debates can facilitate a continuous learning process for both the AI and the physicians. AI models can be updated with new medical data and findings, while physicians can stay abreast of evolving diagnostic strategies and considerations.
    Feedback Loop: The process can create a feedback loop where physicians’ inputs and corrections help to further train and refine the AI models, enhancing their accuracy and relevance over time.

Efficient Resource Utilization

    Time-Saving: By quickly generating and evaluating multiple diagnostic hypotheses, AI chatbots can save physicians time, allowing them to focus on patient care rather than spending extensive periods on differential diagnosis.
    Education and Training: For medical students and residents, this process can be an educational tool, demonstrating the critical thinking and analytical processes involved in making medical diagnoses.

Customization and Flexibility

    Tailored to Needs: The debate process can be customized to fit the specific needs and specialties of physicians, allowing for focused discussions on relevant medical cases and conditions.
    Integration with Medical Systems: This tool can be integrated into existing medical systems and electronic health records (EHR), providing real-time assistance and access to patient-specific data, enhancing the contextual relevance of the diagnoses.

In summary, a structured debate process using AI chatbots could significantly support physicians by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, providing decision support, facilitating continuous learning, saving time, and offering customizable tools that integrate into existing medical workflows. This innovative approach leverages the strengths of AI to complement and augment the expertise of medical professionals.






## Introduction

The **Ensemble GenAI** idea is also explored here, employing a group of chatbots engaged in constructive critique to collaboratively refine and determine the best approach to the given challenge.

  Here are some relevant articles that demonstrate the use of a panel of debating chatbots:

  - [**Wood vs Buffett on NVDA**](/articles/WoodvsBuffett): An emulated debate between Cathie Wood and Warren Buffett on NVDA, as imagined by GenAI chatbots. Also with business models as suggested by chatbots.
  - [**Qualitative Financial Risk Assessment using Collective AI Judgement**](/articles/Risks)：having multiple GenAI chatbots engage in a debate to derive a qualitative assessment of financial risk in regard to a certain given major event.
  - [**A Message from GenAI Chatbots to GenAI Startups**](/articles/TheDebate): find out how two leading GenAI chatbots debate about the future of GenAI startups.

## The Setup

A panel of GenAI chatbots are used to assists in fully developing the design process. 

- The following LLMs are selected for their robust text and vision capabilities:
  - OpenAI gpt-4
  - Anthropic Claude-3-opus-20240229
- These LLMs are accessed via the Python Langchain's ConversationChain class.
- For each design goal, given as a prompt, the debate among the chatbots take place in three rounds:
  - Round 1: Opinion Presentation. Each chatbot presents its opinions regarding the given prompt
  - Round 2: Analysis and Critique. Each chatbot expresses its critiques regarding the opinions given by other chatbots in round 1.
  - Round 3: Resolution and Synthesis. Each chatbot tries to reconcile opponent's opinions with its own to create a synthesized opinion. Unresolved issues are itemized.
- Unless noted otherwise, all prompts are given to a panel of two chatbots
- The chatbots' input is primarily for design guidance and should be critically assessed and verified.

## Goal: Justifying the UIW approach

- **Prompt**: I am building a GenAI chatbot intended for use by enterprises. This chatbot behaves like an individual worker with the ability to operate any existing software GUI intended for human workers, and it is able to communicate in natural language, solve problems, create contents, and work with human or chatbot colleagues in a team in order to complete the assigned task. Please list the pros and cons of this approach.
