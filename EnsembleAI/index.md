Towards a framework for Ensemble AI based on Large Language Models (LLM) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs)

## Why Do We Need Ensemble AI

There are several reasons why supporting a mechanism for a large number of heterogeneous and distributed chatbots to work together as an ensemble AI could be beneficial:

- **Diversity of Knowledge**: Different chatbots may have been trained on different datasets and thus have different areas of expertise. An ensemble of these chatbots could potentially cover a wider range of topics and provide more comprehensive responses.

- **Robustness**: If one chatbot fails or provides an incorrect response, others in the ensemble could potentially correct the mistake or fill in the gap. This redundancy can lead to more robust performance.

- **Personalization**: Different chatbots may have different styles or tones, and an ensemble could potentially adapt to the preferences of individual users by selecting the chatbot that best matches the user’s style or needs.

- **Scalability**: By distributing the workload among multiple chatbots, an ensemble could potentially handle a larger volume of queries than a single chatbot.

- **Continuous Learning**: An ensemble of chatbots could potentially learn from each other’s successes and mistakes, leading to continuous improvement over time.

- **Safety/Security**: In situations where important decisions need to be made, having a panel of expert chatbots can add an extra layer of safety. By requiring consensus among the chatbots, the risk of serious mistakes made by a single chatbot can be significantly reduced.

As mentioned earlier, managing an ensemble of chatbots also presents challenges, such as coordinating their responses, resolving conflicts, and ensuring consistency. These challenges would need to be addressed to effectively leverage the benefits of an ensemble AI.
