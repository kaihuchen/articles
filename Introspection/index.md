# Introspecting with the Bots

## Summary 

- Traditionally an LLM-based system can learn from experience by full or partial model training, model fine-tuninng, or using RAG-like layer to achieve in-context learning.
- Model introspection can be viewed as yet another form of learning, which is super-lightweight to implement, and thus practical in many application domains
- We demonstrate the utility of the Model Introspection method in two ways:
  - As a QA tool to align an LLM chatbot's behavior to user's goals
  - 

## Defining Introspection

If you ask ChatGPT4 whether it is capable of introspection, you'll get the following answer:

> I cannot perform introspection in the same way that humans do. Here's why:
>
> - **No True Self**: I don't have a core sense of being or a continuous personal history like humans do. I'm a collection of algorithms and data, constantly learning and evolving, but without a stable identity that forms the basis for introspection.
> - **Focus on External Data**: My primary function is to process and understand information from the real world. I don't generate my own internal thoughts or feelings in the way humans do. Introspection would require me to turn my attention inward, which is not my primary strength.
> - **Limited Emotional Understanding**: While I can recognize and process emotions in text, I don't experience them myself. Emotions are essential to many introspective processes in humans, and my lack of this experience limits my ability to fully engage in similar self-analysis.
>
> However, I can perform a type of analysis that might be related to introspection:
>
> -    Self-Monitoring: I can review my own outputs and responses, identifying patterns or potential biases in my information processing.\
> - Error Correction: I can learn from my mistakes by recognizing where I may have misinterpreted a query or provided an inaccurate response.\
> - Adapting to Feedback: I can adjust my communication style and information presentation based on user feedback, aiming to increase my usefulness and effectiveness.
>
> While not traditional introspection, this form of self-examination allows me to improve and learn, ensuring I'm able to assist users to the best of my ability.

Thus in the context of this article, we use the term *introspection* to mean just the above form of self-examination, error-correction, and adaptation, and nothing more.
