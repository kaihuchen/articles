# Why develop *Ensemble GenAI*?

*UNFINISHED DRAFT*

## What is *Ensemble GenAI*

*Ensemble GenAI* is a software architecture that combines many generative AI chatbots to provide better functionality than a single chatbot could offer.

For the purpose of this discussion, we will focus on *Ensemble GenAI* with the following characteristics:

- *Heteroneous* chatbots which are built with different desgins, etc. 
- *Distributed* chatbots that scatter about in different geographic locations, hosted on different servers, owned by diffferent organizations, etc.
- *Diverse* chatbots which are trained with different data, specialized for various domains, etc.
- *Collaborative* chatbots.

Are there any existing *Ensemble GenAI* systems? Well, sort of. OpenAI's plugins can be said to be a kind of *Ensemble GenAI* system, but while it offers an assortment of diverse chatbots, it is not heterougeous, not distributed, nor collaborative.

Note that the somewhat similar term **Ensemble AI** commonly refers to use of *multiple machine learning models* in order to achieve better predictive performance, which is different from the *Ensemble GenAI* discussed here. In *Ensemble GenAI* the basic unit is a well-trained chatbot capable of communicating in natural language, while in *Ensemble AI* the basic unit is a machine learning model that infers based on symbolic or numerical inputs.

## Benefits

Why do we want to go into the trouble of developing the type of *Ensemble GenAI* as mentioned above? There are certain types of problems that could benefit from such an architecture:

- Problems that require many specialized chatbots to work together.
- Problems so critical that they require a panel of expert chatbot to decide jointly.
- Problems that can benefit from collaborative discussion or constructive critiques among multiple chatbots.
- Problems that requires human to work together with multiple chatbots. 
- Problems where transparency of the solution process is important. 
- A combination of the above.

## Use Cases

 Here are some scenarios where this approach can excel:

1. Complex, Multi-faceted Tasks:

   - Medical diagnosis: Imagine an ensemble of chatbots trained on various medical specialties, collaborating to analyze a patient's symptoms and suggest potential diagnoses. Each chatbot contributes its domain expertise, while the ensemble considers diverse perspectives for a more comprehensive assessment.
   - Financial planning: An ensemble of chatbots trained on different investment strategies and market sectors can work together to create personalized financial plans. Each offers its recommendations based on the user's goals and risk tolerance, while the ensemble balances them for a robust strategy.
   - Scientific research: Chatbots specializing in different scientific disciplines can collectively analyze data, propose hypotheses, and identify research avenues. This distributed intelligence can accelerate discovery and overcome limitations of single models.

2. Creative and Open-Ended Tasks:

   - Storytelling: An ensemble of chatbots with diverse writing styles and genres can co-create stories, poems, or scripts. Each contributes its unique voice and perspective, leading to richer and more engaging narratives.
   - Product design: Chatbots trained on design principles, user experience, and engineering can brainstorm and iterate on product concepts. The ensemble explores various directions and identifies potential shortcomings, resulting in more innovative and user-centric designs.
   - Marketing and advertising: Chatbots specializing in different marketing channels and audience segments can collaborate to craft targeted and persuasive campaigns. The ensemble considers diverse perspectives and tailors messages for maximum impact across different demographics.

3. Dynamic and Evolving Situations:

   - Crisis management: During emergencies, an ensemble of chatbots can gather information from various sources, assess the situation, and propose response strategies. Each contributes its real-time data and analysis, enabling the ensemble to adapt quickly and effectively to changing circumstances.
   - Personalized education: Chatbots specializing in different subjects and teaching styles can provide individualized learning experiences. The ensemble tailors lessons to each student's needs and learning pace, dynamically adjusting based on their progress and feedback.
   - Scientific collaboration: Researchers in different disciplines can leverage an ensemble of chatbots to share data, discuss findings, and identify new research directions. This distributed collaboration fosters cross-disciplinary insights and accelerates scientific progress.

## Beyond the Problems

The true power of Ensemble GenAI lies in its ability to:

   - Aggregate diverse knowledge and expertise: By combining the strengths of multiple chatbots, the ensemble overcomes the limitations of single models and offers a broader, more comprehensive understanding of the problem space.
   - Foster collective intelligence: Chatbots within the ensemble can learn from each other's interactions and experiences, continuously improving the overall intelligence and adaptability of the system.
   - Provide explainable and transparent reasoning: By understanding the contributions of each chatbot in the ensemble's decision-making process, users gain valuable insights and trust in the system's recommendations.

Developing Ensemble GenAI architectures requires careful consideration of data privacy, security, and ethical implications. However, the potential benefits for tackling complex, multifaceted, and dynamic problems make it a promising approach for advancing AI capabilities and solving real-world challenges.
