# Brainstorming with Chatbots on building the Universal Information Worker

*Last updated: March 12, 2024*

This is a working log that serves the following purposes:

- This is a technical design document regarding how to implement a Universal Information Worker (UIW) for the enterprises. The motivation for UIW can be found [HERE](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kaihuchen_title-building-a-genai-based-universal-information-activity-7173027315751333888-nGuM/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).
- This is also meant as a test ground for implementing a substantial GenAI enterprise software with the help of chatbots, from brainstorming to actual implementation. 
- This is also a test ground for the *Ensemble GenAI* idea, where a panel of debating chatbots are used to work together under the *constructive critique* process in order to hash out an answer to the question at hand.

  Here are some relevant articles that demonstrate the process:

  - [**Wood vs Buffett on NVDA**](WoodvsBuffett): An emulated debate between Cathie Wood and Warren Buffett on NVDA, as imagined by GenAI chatbots. Also with business models as suggested by chatbots.
  - [**Qualitative Financial Risk Assessment using Collective AI Judgement**](Risks)ï¼šhaving multiple GenAI chatbots engage in a debate to derive a qualitative assessment of financial risk in regard to a certain given major event.
  - [**A Message from GenAI Chatbots to GenAI Startups**](TheDebate): find out how two leading GenAI chatbots debate about the future of GenAI startups.

## The Setup


A panel of GenAI chatbots are used to help us flesh out the design process from end to end. 

- The following LLMs for their robust text and vision capabilities:
  - OpenAI gpt-4
  - Anthropic Claude-3-opus-20240229
- Each LLM is accessed through Python Langchain's ConversationChain class
- For each given query, the debate among the chatbots take place in three rounds:
  - Round 1: Opinion Presentation. Each chatbot expresses its opinions regarding the given query
  - Round 2: Analysis and Critique. Each chatbot expresses its cretiques regarding the opinions given by other chatbots in round 1. Each chatbot also assign each critique with a score on a 1-10 scale.
  - Round 3: Resolution and Synthesis. Each chatbot tries to reconcile opponent's opinions with its own to create a synthesized opinion. Issues that cannot be reconciled are listed separately.
- Unless noted otherwise, all prompts are given to a panel of two chatbots
- Unless noted otherwise, only the reconciled round-3 results are presented so that this article does not get excessively long. The lists given in round 3 may also get truncated if it gets too long.

## Drilling down: 

Prompt: How 
<!-- Imagine that you are an entrepreneur in generative AI, and you want to use a technology involving many GenAI chatbots to help with making important decision together in order to improve prediction accuracy and reliability. Please make brainstorming suggestions on which domains and what kind of applications might have a sizable market, that are suitable for the said technology.  -->

**Gemini**: Here's a brainstorm of domains and applications suitable for a decision-making system powered by collaborative generative AI chatbots, focusing on market potential:

  - Domains with Big Data, Complex Decisions, and High Stakes:

    - Finance:
        - Investment Analysis: Each chatbot could specialize in a different market sector, analysis style (fundamental, technical, etc.), or asset class. Their collective "wisdom," filtered through a decision engine, could offer more balanced investment recommendations.
        - Risk Management: Diverse chatbots trained on different risk models (credit, market, operational) could identify potential blind spots overlooked by traditional risk assessments.
        - Algorithmic Trading: Chatbots could generate new trading ideas or stress-test current strategies, potentially identifying unforeseen scenarios and enhancing optimization.

    - Healthcare:
        - Diagnosis and Treatment Planning: Chatbots trained on specific disease areas, medical literature, and anonymized patient data could suggest differential diagnoses or generate personalized treatment options, augmenting physicians' abilities.
        - Clinical Trial Optimization: Designing a robust clinical trial is complex. Chatbots could identify gaps in study designs, anticipate recruitment challenges, and suggest ways to streamline the process.
        - Medical Research: Analyzing vast amounts of research literature is labor-intensive. Chatbots could flag promising correlations, generate new hypotheses, or summarize vast bodies of research on specific topics.

    - Supply Chain Management:
        - Demand Forecasting: Chatbots could pull data from diverse sources like social media, weather patterns, and economic indicators to generate more accurate demand predictions, mitigating stockouts or oversupply.
        - Logistics Optimization: Routing, real-time traffic and disruption updates, and shipment consolidation could be enhanced by chatbots collaborating to propose the most efficient logistics solutions.
        - Supplier Analysis: AI bots could assess supplier capacity, risks (political, environmental), and compliance, adding context to traditional metrics for procurement decisions.

    - Government and Policy:
        - Policy Design: Chatbots could simulate the potential outcomes of different policy approaches, considering social, economic, and environmental impacts, helping officials make data-driven decisions.
        - Resource Allocation: Analyzing complex data sets on demographics, infrastructure, and needs could allow chatbots to recommend areas for focused funding or resource deployment.
        - Crisis Scenario Planning: Collaborating chatbots could rapidly analyze information during complex emergencies to propose evacuation routes, identify vulnerable populations, or predict cascading effects.

  - Key Considerations for Success:

    - Diversity of Data & Models: The strength of this approach lies in drawing from multiple perspectives. Training chatbots on different data sources and analytical models enhances decision-making.
    - Transparency and Explainability: To gain user trust, especially in high-stakes scenarios, the system must explain how it combined the outputs of the various chatbots and why it generated a particular recommendation.
    - Security and Bias: Careful attention must be paid to data security and protection against inherent biases in training data.
    - Human-in-the-loop Architecture: This isn't about replacing human judgment, but augmenting it. Experts should retain the final decision-making authority, informed by the collective intelligence of the chatbot system.
