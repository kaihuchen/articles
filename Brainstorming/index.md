# Brainstorming with Bots

*DRAFT*

This is a work log of how I employ an ensemble of diverse GenAI chatbots to assist in developing a startup concept. The startup idea is to find practical uses for the Ensemble GenAI architecture.

It's all quite recursive, of course, just like the myth of the Ouroboros, the snake that consumes its own tail.

But trust me, this is going to be how many of us work in the future, and here is the Step#0 of this recursion loop.

- **More**

## The Setup

We use a panel of GenAI chatbots to help us flesh out the whole things, as follows:

- Build a simple system for multiple GenAI chatbots to debate on a given topic, and in the result come up with an opinion that all sides can agree on. For ease of reference, let's call this EAI0 (Ensemble AI, version 0).
- *Naming the system*: Use EAI0 to come up with a list of proper names for the system. Human picks one and name this system as such.
- Finding suitable target domains that can benefit from the use of such a system

*to be filled*

## Finding a good name

Prompt: I am building a system that employs a panel (or ensemble) of GenAI chatbots to debate each other in order to get things done. Please come up with some catchy names to describe this system.

## Finding target application domains

**Prompt**: Imagine that you are an entrepreneur in generative AI, and you want to use a technology involving many GenAI chatbots to help with making important decision together in order to improve prediction accuracy and reliability. Please make brainstorming suggestions on which domains and what kind of applications might have a sizable market, that are suitable for the said technology. 

**Gemini**: Here's a brainstorm of domains and applications suitable for a decision-making system powered by collaborative generative AI chatbots, focusing on market potential:

  - Domains with Big Data, Complex Decisions, and High Stakes:

    - Finance:
        - Investment Analysis: Each chatbot could specialize in a different market sector, analysis style (fundamental, technical, etc.), or asset class. Their collective "wisdom," filtered through a decision engine, could offer more balanced investment recommendations.
        - Risk Management: Diverse chatbots trained on different risk models (credit, market, operational) could identify potential blind spots overlooked by traditional risk assessments.
        - Algorithmic Trading: Chatbots could generate new trading ideas or stress-test current strategies, potentially identifying unforeseen scenarios and enhancing optimization.

    - Healthcare:
        - Diagnosis and Treatment Planning: Chatbots trained on specific disease areas, medical literature, and anonymized patient data could suggest differential diagnoses or generate personalized treatment options, augmenting physicians' abilities.
        - Clinical Trial Optimization: Designing a robust clinical trial is complex. Chatbots could identify gaps in study designs, anticipate recruitment challenges, and suggest ways to streamline the process.
        - Medical Research: Analyzing vast amounts of research literature is labor-intensive. Chatbots could flag promising correlations, generate new hypotheses, or summarize vast bodies of research on specific topics.

    - Supply Chain Management:
        - Demand Forecasting: Chatbots could pull data from diverse sources like social media, weather patterns, and economic indicators to generate more accurate demand predictions, mitigating stockouts or oversupply.
        - Logistics Optimization: Routing, real-time traffic and disruption updates, and shipment consolidation could be enhanced by chatbots collaborating to propose the most efficient logistics solutions.
        - Supplier Analysis: AI bots could assess supplier capacity, risks (political, environmental), and compliance, adding context to traditional metrics for procurement decisions.

    - Government and Policy:
        - Policy Design: Chatbots could simulate the potential outcomes of different policy approaches, considering social, economic, and environmental impacts, helping officials make data-driven decisions.
        - Resource Allocation: Analyzing complex data sets on demographics, infrastructure, and needs could allow chatbots to recommend areas for focused funding or resource deployment.
        - Crisis Scenario Planning: Collaborating chatbots could rapidly analyze information during complex emergencies to propose evacuation routes, identify vulnerable populations, or predict cascading effects.

  - Key Considerations for Success:

    - Diversity of Data & Models: The strength of this approach lies in drawing from multiple perspectives. Training chatbots on different data sources and analytical models enhances decision-making.
    - Transparency and Explainability: To gain user trust, especially in high-stakes scenarios, the system must explain how it combined the outputs of the various chatbots and why it generated a particular recommendation.
    - Security and Bias: Careful attention must be paid to data security and protection against inherent biases in training data.
    - Human-in-the-loop Architecture: This isn't about replacing human judgment, but augmenting it. Experts should retain the final decision-making authority, informed by the collective intelligence of the chatbot system.
