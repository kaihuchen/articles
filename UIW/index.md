# Building a Limited-AGI Agent for Enterprises


*DRAFT*

We want to build a kind of limited-AGI agent for the enterprises, as a drop-in work unit for performing information/knowledge processing. We call this type of agent a *Universal Information Worker (UIW)*.

The term *AGI* (Artificial General Intelligence) is not well-defined and often controversial, but we brought it up here only as a shorthand to convey the broad target of what we are aiming for, but at the same time we will also greatly limit its scope so that it can be realized in the near term. 

## UIW Use Cases

Today's entreprises are held together with all kinds of softwares, data stores, and human workers. A UIW agent could potentially play an important role under the following situations:

- The work involved is narrowly scoped, and highly repetitive.
- The tools used for the task are mainly existing softwares.
- The required communication with other humans, whether co-workers or customers, are relatively straightforward and can be wholly achieved using text or voice.


## 

*Adversarial actors*
*Intervention by human supervisor*

UIW General requirements (and non-requirements):

- Highly adatable, can be easily trained to take on new tasks, learn to use a wide range of software tools, 
- can think for itself and get its job done, communicates well in natural language, and 

- Performs the repetitive work of many information or knowledge workers.
- Be able to learn to operate most softwares easily.
- Able to communicates with other workers in natural languages.
- Posses the discipline to work efficiently as a member of a larger team.
- Posses the common sense regarding security, privacy, etc.
- Can be easily deployed at scale
- Auditable transparent
- Collaboration
- Can be aligned easily with corporate guidelines or brand requirements.


The following are either deferred goals, or not requirements at all:

- Physical body 
- Highly specialized: workflow, enterprise function, advanced analytics, decision support
- 
- 
- General Learning Ability: AGI can learn from various types of data and experiences, acquiring new skills and knowledge without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.

EAGI:

- Reasoning and Problem Solving: It can apply logical reasoning, solve complex problems, and make decisions under uncertain conditions, much like a human.

EAGI:

- Adaptability: AGI can adapt to new and changing environments, tasks, and requirements, demonstrating flexibility in its operations.

- Understanding Context: It has the ability to understand context and apply its knowledge appropriately in different situations, recognizing subtle nuances and adjusting its behavior accordingly.

EAGI 

- Transfer Learning: AGI can transfer knowledge and skills learned in one domain to another, leveraging previous experiences to quickly master new tasks.

EAGI: we can limit this to the transfer learning between the use of enterprise software tools.

- Autonomy: It can operate independently, making its own decisions and taking actions without human intervention.

EAGI will make decisions and take actions within the scope of its assigned duties, nothing more.

- Emotional Intelligence: AGI can recognize and interpret human emotions, potentially responding to them in a way that exhibits empathy and understanding.

EAGI: deferred

- Creativity and Innovation: It can generate new ideas, solutions, and approaches, demonstrating creativity in problem-solving and other activities.

EAGI: deferred

- Intuitive Understanding: AGI possesses an intuitive understanding of the world, enabling it to make sense of complex and abstract concepts in a human-like manner.

EAGI: deferred

- Consciousness and Self-Awareness: While still a theoretical aspect, AGI might exhibit some form of consciousness or self-awareness, acknowledging its existence and understanding its own cognitive processes.

EAGI: deferred




Feasibility study:

- Adaptive Learning and Reasoning: 
The system should have advanced machine learning capabilities, enabling it to learn from various data sources and experiences, adapt to new situations, and make informed decisions based on that learning.

- Natural Language Processing (NLP): 
It must excel in understanding, interpreting, and generating human language, allowing it to communicate effectively with users in multiple languages, understand context, and produce written reports or summaries.

- Data Integration and Management: 
The AI should seamlessly integrate with existing enterprise systems (like ERP, CRM, and database systems) and manage data across these platforms efficiently, ensuring accurate and timely information retrieval and processing.

- Advanced Analytics and Decision Support: Capabilities to analyze large datasets, identify patterns, predict trends, and provide actionable insights would be critical, supporting decision-making processes at various organizational levels.

    Security and Privacy: Ensuring data security and privacy compliance (such as GDPR and HIPAA) is essential, incorporating features like secure data handling, encryption, and access controls to protect sensitive information.

    Customization and Scalability: The system should be customizable to fit the specific needs of different enterprises and scalable to handle varying workloads, from small tasks to large-scale projects.

    Task Automation and Workflow Management: It should automate routine tasks and manage complex workflows, improving efficiency and freeing human workers for more strategic activities.

    Interoperability and Collaboration: The ability to work with other AI systems and tools, facilitating collaboration among human and AI workers, is important for maximizing productivity and innovation.

    Ethical and Transparent Operations: The AI should operate ethically, with mechanisms in place to ensure transparency, fairness, and accountability in its decision-making processes.

    User Interface and Experience: A user-friendly interface that is accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise, enabling them to interact with the AI effectively and efficiently.
