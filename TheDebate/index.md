# A debate of two GenAI giants on the future of GenAI - a case study on Ensemble AI

Running a GenAI (Generative AI) startup feels like racing alongside elephants — everything is moving swiftly, and missteps can lead to being trampled.

So How can we anticipate the future of the GenAI landscape, especially from a startup’s perspective?

Wouldn't it be fun if we just let the top two GenAI contenders fight each other out on the topic. I am sure Douglas Hofstadter (renouned author of the book *Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid*) will be proud of us for not having forgotten about the beauty of recursion.

This is also a case study on the utility values of the Ensemble AI achitecture.

## Debate format

On one corner we have the Google Gemini Advanced, and on the other we have the OpenAI GPT-4. This debate takes place on February 15, 2024. 

This debatee will proceed using the format of a *constructive critique debate* or *opinion-based debate*. In this format, both sides present their viewpoints on a topic without necessarily taking opposing stances. Instead of arguing against each other, they focus on analyzing and critiquing the merits and flaws of each other’s opinions.

This debate proceeds as follows:

1. Opinion Presentation:
   - Each side presents its opinion or perspective on the topic.
   - They explain their reasoning, provide evidence, and share  insights related to the issue.
2. Analysis and Critique:
   - After both opinions are presented, each side engages in a thoughtful analysis.
   - They critically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each other’s viewpoints.
   - This involves identifying logical fallacies, assessing the quality of evidence, and questioning assumptions.
3. Nuanced Discussion:
   - Unlike traditional debates where one side wins and the other loses, constructive critique debates encourage nuanced discussion.
   - Participants explore shades of gray, acknowledge valid points from the opposing side, and seek common ground.
4. Audience Engagement:
   - The audience plays an essential role by actively listening to both opinions.
   - They can ask questions, seek clarification, and contribute to the depth of the debate.
5. Resolution or Synthesis:
   - Instead of declaring a winner, the goal is to arrive at a deeper understanding of the topic.
   - Participants may synthesize elements from both opinions or propose a resolution that incorporates the best aspects of each side.
