# Create a Collaborative Drone Swarm War Game Simulator with GPT-o1-preview

*DRAFT*

#### Summary
- Recorded below is my initial experiment with OpenAI's new GPT-o1-preview model for coding a non-trivial system from scratch, without manual code tweaking.
- The task here is to create a Drone Swarm War Game Simulator, 
- This experiment shows that I have no problem using o1-preview in many iterations of interactions to achieve the code that I had in mind.
- It also shows that this model could violate some of the given directives, in its pursue to fulfill other goals. This is something that user needs to get under control, either through prompt management or...

## Introduction

OpenAI's newly-released GPT-01-preview model (referred-to simply as "o1" or "the model" below) is supposedly very strong with coding, reaching the 89th percentile in Codeforces competitions, so I want to test it out with a reasonablly substantial coding project to see how practical it really is. In particular, I am looking to achieve the following:

- Verify that the model indeed can fulfill complex requirements to create functional code.
- Verify that the model is well-behaved for supporting iterative development.
- To find a good solution for the problem of maximizing the efficiency of massive autonomous drone swarm in the context of war game simulation.

## Notable Achievements



## Problem Description

simulation at strategic level, does not simulate aerial dynamics
Autonomous drone swarm without manual interve

## Iterations

### Iteration 1. Basic Simulator




#### Prompts

- create a Python program with a GUI that simulates a drone swarm that jointly hunt down a number of static adversaries on the playing field.

- update the program so that user is allowed an optional command to restart the game with the targets at random position and the drones starting from the same random position

- update the program so that each drone disappears after hitting an target. Also add a running timer at the lower end of the screen to show the total time used to either eliminated all targets or exhausted all drones. The timer stops at the end of the game.

- Got the following error:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/mnt/c/_backup/ml/tests/swarms/main.py", line 200, in <module>
        main()
      File "/mnt/c/_backup/ml/tests/swarms/main.py", line 159, in main
        adversaries.remove(adversary)
    ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list

- update the program so as to minimize the time needed to destroy all targets. For this assume that all drones are controlled by the same logic, and each has access to all information, including its own position, and the position of all targets.
- The program has regressed, and now it fails to pause at the end and offer the choices to either quit or restart the game.
- keep all features in the program, expect updating the program on the assumption that each target is not visible to a drone unless it is less than X pixels away. Also default X to 100 and allow X to be specified from command line. 
- incrementally update the last program, so that the color of a target is light red if it is invisible to any drones.

--------------------------

Create a Python program with a GUI for simulating a drone swarm that jointly hunt down a number of static adversaries on the playing field. The game ends either when all targets are eliminated, or when all drones are gone. 

Each drone disappears after hitting an target. There is a running timer at the lower left of the screen to show the total time used to run the simulation.
The program pauses at the end of the game and offer the choices to either quit or restart the game.

Each target is not visible to a drone unless it is less than X pixels away. Also default X to 100 and allow X to be specified from command line. The color of a target is light red if it is invisible to any drones.

Additional start up arguments include: the number of drones, and the number of targets.

Each drone travels linearly and bounce off the border when it gets there

#Also create a GIF file named game.gif that records a complete game run.


all good. except that background should be black, drones should be green, and targets should be red, and timer should stop when the game ends.

all drones should be moving at the same fixed speed.


### Iteration 2: Optimization of time needed 

Prompt: Update the program to minimize the time needed to destroy all targets. 

Explanation of the Optimization:

    Hungarian Algorithm for Optimal Assignment:
        The algorithm finds the optimal one-to-one assignment between drones and targets that minimizes the total cost (in this case, distance).
        By minimizing the total distance, drones reach their targets in the shortest possible time collectively.

    Dynamic Reassignment:
        Targets and drones may be eliminated during the game.
        The assignment is recalculated at each frame to adjust for any changes.
        This ensures drones are always assigned to the closest available targets.

    Efficiency Gains:
        By optimally assigning drones to targets, the total time needed to destroy all targets is minimized.
        Drones no longer waste time moving randomly or heading towards distant targets when closer ones are available.

Potential Enhancements:

    Cluster Targets:
        If targets are clustered, drones could be programmed to move towards clusters rather than individual targets.

    Collision Avoidance:
        Implement logic for drones to avoid colliding with each other.

    Dynamic Obstacles:
        Introduce obstacles that drones must navigate around, adding complexity to the pathfinding.

### Iteratin 3: Correct model's optiomzation mistake

Me: The optimization performed here seems to assume that the drone can detect the location of any targets no matter how far away they are?

GPT: You are absolutely correct. The previous implementation assumes that drones have knowledge of all target locations regardless of their visibility range, which contradicts the simulation's rules.

To adhere to the visibility constraints:

    Drones should only detect and assign themselves to targets within their visibility range.
    When no targets are visible, drones should move in a way that allows them to explore the area to find new targets.

Below is the updated code that addresses these concerns:

### Iteration 4: Coordinated Swarm Search Strategy 

  Me: Assuming that all drones are able to communicate with each other fully, can you come up with a more coordinated search strategy that will work better in finding hidden targets?

  GPT: Certainly! With full communication between drones, we can develop a coordinated search strategy that significantly improves the efficiency of finding hidden targets. By coordinating their movements, drones can systematically cover the entire playing field, avoid redundant searches, and share information about discovered targets.
  Coordinated Search Strategy with Communication
  1. Divide the Playing Field into Sectors

      Grid Division:
          Divide the playing field into a grid of equal-sized sectors.
          The number of sectors can be equal to the number of drones or adjusted based on field size and drone capabilities.
          Each drone is assigned a unique sector to search.

  2. Systematic Search Patterns

      Lawnmower (Boustrous) Pattern:
          Within their assigned sectors, drones follow a lawnmower pattern.
          They move back and forth in straight lines, covering the entire sector methodically.
          This ensures complete coverage without gaps or overlaps.

  3. Communication and Information Sharing

      Shared Map:
          Drones maintain a shared map of the playing field, marking areas that have been searched.
          When a drone finds a target, it updates the shared map with the target's location.
      Dynamic Reassignment:
          If a drone completes its sector and there are unsearched sectors remaining, it can be reassigned to assist in those sectors.
          Drones communicate their status and coordinate to optimize coverage.

  4. Avoiding Redundancy

      Collision Avoidance:
          Drones share their positions and planned paths to avoid collisions.
      Efficient Target Elimination:
          When a target is detected, the closest drone engages, and others avoid redundant efforts.

### Iteration 5: Shidlds, Kill Power, Swarm Attack, and Waste Minimization

Prompt: update the program so that each drone may have a kill power level between 1 and 5 (inclusive). Each target may have a shield level between 0 to 4 (inclusive). Adjust the joint search algorithm as necessary, so that multiple drones can be coordinated to attack a strong target, since once a target is found then it is visible to all drones. Also create an algorithm to minimize waste, for example using a level 4 drone to kill a target with 0 shield is a waste of 3 levels of kill power.  

Update the UI so that shield level of targets, and kill power level of drones, are clearly displayed numerically as text and also updated as their values as they change.

Implement joint search strategy to maximize the efficiency of finding invisible targets. Also initialize the distribution of kill power level of drones evenly to be between 1 and 3


currently a target is eliminate when hit by a drone, regardless of their respective values. The correct logic is to deduct a target's value with the value of the drone, and the target is eliminated if its value becomes negative, otherwise the target stays around with the deducted value.


Update the program to add a command-line startup argument "--maxk" (or -k) indicating the maximum kill power that a drone can have, default to 4. Also add another "--maxs" (or -s) indicating the maximum shield level that a target can have. Default to 5. Do not change anything else.

<!--

update the program to implement the following over-all directives, in descending priorities:

1. Maximize the total values of the targets destroyed
2. Minimize the total values used of the drones used to destroy targets
3. Minimize the time needed to complete the overall mission.



Interesting observations:

- When a drone discovers a target, it may not proceed to hit it if it is "not worth it" (i.e., the value of the drone is much higher than the target). Instead the target is marked (i.e., turning red in the UI), and left to another matching drone to hit it. This is the result of GPT choosing a strategy to maximize kill values.



### Iteration 5: Inject Fog of War

Prompt: update the program so that the swarm can operate even when the central control is gone. This means that the drone swarm obey central control when it is available, otherwise each drone operates with only local control based on the latest information that it has. For this the code must formalize the communication between the central and each drone, so such communication are explicitly represented and stored for later access.  

Add a command-line argument "--control-mode" (or -c) with values of either ON (default), OFF, or RANDOM. In the case of OFF there is no central control at all, and a drone cannot be aware of information found by other drones (such as location of targets found), no target assignment by the central thus each drone makes its own decision, etc. In the case of RANDOM, then the communication between central and drones goes ON and OFF at random time points. 

Note: this is a very demanding feature.

### Battle Heuristics
- in the beginning of the game we can see the entire swarm suddenly change direction to move toward a discovered target. This is actually a wasteful behavior at the swarm level, since while some drones should be assigned to cover the target, the rest of the swarm should go attack or search for other targets.

    Solution

    To address this, we'll make the following changes:

        Restrict Available Drones for Target Assignment:
            Only consider drones in the 'searching' state as available for target assignment.
            Drones already assigned to unsearched areas ('moving_to_unsearched') will continue their tasks.

        Prioritize Drones Based on Proximity:
            Assign drones to targets based on their distance to the target.
            This ensures that drones closest to the target are assigned, reducing travel time and resource wastage.

        Efficient Drone Assignment:
            Assign only the minimum required number of drones to meet the target's shield level.
            The rest of the drones will continue their current tasks.

- Currently drones are assigned to attack a target as soon as it is discovered. This is actually kind of a waste since in that case we lose the reconnaissance power of the drone as well. As such it makes sense to allocate a period of time R for all drones to spread out and search for targets, then after the period expired then all drones can go into the attack mode. Also update the command line arguments to allow the specification of R, and default it to 20 seconds.

- near the end of the game where are only a few drones left, they should be immediately assigned to attack targets, and not loitering around looking for more targets. (This makes sense because extensive reconnaissance is already done earlier)

## Conclusions

- GPT-o1-preview is amazingly powerful in coding. It has written all of the codes in this test based only on very high-level conversations. In particular,
  - It seems to have in-depth understanding of the task given to it, and capable of suggesting meaningful ways to improve upon my specifications.
  - It is able to come up with good solutions (e.g., how to coordinate the drones to perform effective search pattern) when given only very high level directions (e.g., minimize kill time)
  - It is capable of communicating with user effectively to explain its design decisions for a certain aspect of its code. 
- GPT has ignored prior directives in several occasions, which on the plus side it shows that GPT is able to probe for good solutions, but on the negative side this shows the importance of careful directive/guardrail management. For example:
  - In iteration 2 the directive that targets are not visible unless it is near by was ignored. This results in the drones heading straight toward targets from the very beginning, which results in unreasonably efficiency.
  - In iteration 4 the directive that any drone is to be erased after it hits a target got ignored. Here is the relevant dialog:

    Me: In this code, does a drone gets erased after it has hit a target?
    GPT: No, in the provided code, a drone does not get erased after it has hit a target. Unlike previous implementations where drones were removed upon destroying a target, this version keeps drones active even after they eliminate a target. This design choice was made to maximize the utilization of drones for searching the entire field, thereby improving the efficiency of finding and destroying all targets.

- No doubt a powerful model like GPT-o1 is going to contribute mightily to the creation of all kinds of codes, from small agent module to very large and complex systems. 
- It also showcases the importance of directive management for a powerful automatic coding system like GPT.  In other words, it is preferrable that there is a built-in mechanism for a user to specify levels of directives that the system must adhere to, and that user should be immediately alerted of any conflicts or violation of the directives. While much of these can be pushed to the user to create elaborate prompts, it is nonethless going to make the system harder to use and less safe.
