# The Making of an Expert GenAI Chatbot

*DRAFT*

Very advanced general-purpose chatbots are now widely accessible. It is only inevitable that highly specialized *expert chatbots* will become available for fulfilling many purposes. 

Here we use the term *expert chatbots* to distinguish from chatbots that are shallowly *specialized* for performing some simple tasks.

Here is a table to outline the differences between the two: 

|   | Expert chatbots | Specialized chatbots |
|---|----|----|
| Typical purpose | Domain-specific answers | Engaging conversation, broader knowledge |
| Scope | Narrow & deep | Wide & shallow |
| New vocabularies| Many | Few |
| Custom logic | Yes | No |
| Complex reasoning | Yes | No |
| Domain-specific knowledge and data | Lots | Few & simple |
| Per-user customization | Yes | No |
| Need model fine-tuning | Typically Yes | No |
| Accuracy requirement | High | Not cricitcal |
| Reliability requirement | High | Not critical |
| Typical usage | As huamn expert assistant | Consumer facing |
| Explanability | High | Not critical |
| Integration with legacy systems/data | Common | No |
| Training/fine-tuning | Commonly require curated data | Usually not needed |
| Human oversight | May be needed for critical tasks | Usually not needed |
| Business model | B2B is common | Usually B2C |
| Implementation cost | High | Could be simple and quick |
| Integration with human workflow | Typical | No |
| User training | Usually expected | No |
| Change management | Important | Not important |
| Security requirements | High | Low |
| Privacy requirements | High | Low |
| Liability considerations | High | Low |
| Compliance to regulations | Often Yes | Mostly No |


## How Expert Chatbot vs. Traditional Enterprise Software

While there are similarities in the overall deployment of enterprise-class software, the nature of expert GenAI chatbots introduces significant differences. Here's a breakdown:

**Differences from Traditional Enterprise Software**

1. **Non-Deterministic Outputs:**  Traditional software follows predictable rules â€“ inputs generate specific outputs. GenAI chatbots have a degree of stochasticity (randomness).  Their responses are influenced by training data and model architecture, making them less predictable and harder to fully test for every scenario. 

2. **Evolving Knowledge Base:**  Unlike software with a relatively static codebase, GenAI chatbots are continuously learning. Their knowledge and responses may evolve as they're exposed to new information or fine-tuned, requiring ongoing monitoring and maintenance.

3. **Need for Explainability:** When an accounting program calculates a balance sheet, there's inherent explainability. In domains like healthcare or law, an expert chatbot might need to justify its responses or trace its decision-making process. This is a complex challenge not shared by most traditional software. 

4. **Subjectivity in Evaluation:** Measuring traditional software success often relies on objective metrics accuracy, efficiency, user adoption. Evaluating  GenAI chatbots can be more subjective. Do you prioritize the correctness of answers or the human-likeness of the conversation? This requires careful metric selection.

5. **Data as the Critical Asset:** With traditional software, the codebase is the core intellectual property. For expert GenAI chatbots, the meticulously curated and structured training data is equally, if not more, important for its specialized performance. 

**Similarities to Traditional Enterprise Software**

* **Integration Challenges:** Both require integrating with existing systems and databases within an enterprise.
* **Security and Compliance:** Both need to meet security standards and adhere to any industry-specific regulations.
* **Change Management:** Both may require change management and user training to be successfully adopted into workflows.




## Other Things to Watch Out For

### External Computation Modules

It is unwise to try to get a chatbot to do everthing. 
Math

For enterprise, 
Oftentimes it is easier, safer, and more efficient to interface with legacy system, rather than trying to migration all functionalities into the chatbot.



### Reasoning

### Ensemble GenAI

### Trustworthiness


If you are an enterprise trying to adopt GenAI chatbots 

gradual migration



Get a trustworthy partner 
don't do it by yourself, unless..
