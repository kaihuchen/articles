# The Making of an Expert GenAI Chatbot

*DRAFT*

Very advanced general-purpose chatbots are now widely accessible. It is only inevitable that highly specialized *expert chatbots* will become available for fulfilling many purposes. 

Here we use the term *expert chatbots* to distinguish from chatbots that are shallowly *specialized* for performing some simple tasks.

Here is a table to outline the differences between the two: 

|   | Expert chatbots | Specialized chatbots |
|---|----|----|
| Typical purpose | Domain-specific answers | Engaging conversation, broader knowledge |
| Scope | Narrow & deep | Wide & shallow |
| New vocabularies| Many | Few |
| Custom logic | Yes | No |
| Complex reasoning | Yes | No |
| Domain-specific knowledge and data | Lots | Few & simple |
| Per-user customization | Yes | No |
| Need model fine-tuning | Typically Yes | No |
| Accuracy requirement | High | Not cricitcal |
| Reliability requirement | High | Not critical |
| Typical usage | As huamn expert assistant | Consumer facing |
| Explanability | High | Not critical |
| Integration with legacy systems/data | Common | No |
| Training/fine-tuning | Commonly require curated data | Usually not needed |
| Human oversight | May be needed for critical tasks | Usually not needed |
| Business model | B2B is common | Usually B2C |
| Implementation cost | High | Could be simple and quick |
| Integration with human workflow | Typical | No |
| User training | Usually expected | No |
| Change management | Important | Not important |
| Security requirements | High | Low |
| Privacy requirements | High | Low |
| Liability considerations | High | Low |
| Migration |||
