**Notes on Suggestions Not Fully Incorporated or Adjusted:**

- **Public Relations (PR) Agency Engagement:**
  - While engaging a PR agency specializing in healthcare technology is a valuable suggestion, we have decided to first leverage our in-house PR capabilities to manage media relations and press releases. This approach allows us to maintain close control over our messaging and manage costs effectively. We will reassess the need for an external PR agency after evaluating the results of our initial efforts.
  
- **Employee Advocacy:**
  - We agree that employee advocacy can expand our reach. However, to ensure compliance with healthcare regulations and company policies, we will develop clear guidelines and provide training before encouraging employees to share company content. This will be implemented in a controlled manner to mitigate any potential risks.

---

**Conclusion**

By incorporating the marketing team's suggestions, we have strengthened our GTM playbook, particularly in the areas of marketing strategy, content development, and risk management. The enhanced plan will enable us to effectively engage our target audience and achieve our market objectives.
